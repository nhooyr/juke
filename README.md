#BEING COMPLETLY REDEVELOPED

A terminal snake game in which the primary objective is to juke (basically dodge and attack other snakes) other players as well as get food to make yourself more long.

**LINUX/OSX ONLY**

I didn't use a terminal library but it should work on any modern terminal emulator that supports xterm control sequences

Install with

	go get github.com/nhooyr/juke

As long as $GOPATH/bin is in your path just run it with

	juke

Check out the settings/controls with

	juke -help

And the rules with

     juke -rules

But you should be able to figure out most of it just by playing the game for like 2 minutes.

**ITS MUCH MUCH MORE FUN WITH FRIENDS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU PLAY AROUND WITH ALL THE SETTINGS!**
