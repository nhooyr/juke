# juke
A terminal snake game in which the primary objective is to juke (basically dodge and attack other snakes) other players as well as get food to make yourself more long.

**LINUX/OSX ONLY**

I didn't use a library but it should work on any modern terminal emulator that supports xterm

Install with

	go get github.com/nhooyr/juke

As long as $GOPATH/bin is in your path just run it with

	juke

Check out the rules/settings/how to play with

	juke -help

**ITS MUCH MUCH MORE FUN WITH FRIENDS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU PLAY AROUND WITH ALL THE SETTINGS!**
